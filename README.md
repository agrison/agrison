**Hey, I'm Alexandre 👋**

But everybody calls me **Alex**.

I'm a Software Engineer from [Metz](https://metz.fr/)/France 🇫🇷 and working as a Tech Lead & Software Craftsman in [Luxembourg](https://luxembourg.public.lu) 🇱🇺.

In my spare time I like to code 👨🏻‍💻 in various languages including Java, Clojure/ClojureScript ❤️, Javascript, Python, Ruby, OCaml, and a few other. 
I'm interested in both backend and frontend having practiced them extensively.

From APIs to mobile, through cloud and databases, preferrably using a functional programming language.

Beside coding 👨‍💻, I'm passionate about travels 🌄, photography 📷, football ⚽, badminton 🏸, music 🎶, movies 🎥 and guitars 🎸. 

You can find me at [grison.me](https://grison.me) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/algrison)

Cheers!
